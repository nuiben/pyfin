## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python 3.10, VScode (or an IDE of your choosing), MS Excel or Google Sheets.

Finance is a fast moving industry, and those who are looking to save time and add value to their teams can progress their career by picking up Python. Python is beginner friendly, and great program for math and data manipulation. 

This course aims to teach you the fundamentals of Python in a learn-by-doing approach. We walkthrough Al Sweigart's _Automate the Boring Stuff in Python_ to introduce concepts like data structures, if-statements, loops, lists, libraries, and more. The pacing of these first few chapters are meant to reinforce learning with spaced repetition and active recall via Anki.

By the end of this course you will be preparing files before even openining an Excel sheet, automating tedious reports, and have a firm understanding of how you can use Python to speed up your workflow.

## Optimizations:


The first cohort of this class are a few Finance professionals who are eager to propel their careers. We will be working together to improve the slide-deck, remove redundant or unhelpful projects, and build projects which they actually plan on using in their day jobs.

## Lessons Learned:

Python is a deep language with a ton of functionality, while I was familiar with how to write basic programs, this program has taught me how robust and well established Python is as a language. Currently I am working with the Pandas DataFrame and NumPy to test the capstone project for this course.
